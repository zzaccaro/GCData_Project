# Getting and Cleaning Data Project
For the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization on Coursera  

Zach Zaccaro

## Overview  
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

A full description of the data used in this project can be found at [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)  

The data can be found [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).  

## Getting Started
After you unzip the data and are ready to run the script, make sure your working directory is set correctly in the run_analysis.R script. Also make sure your starting directory is at the first level of the UCI HAR Dataset folder.  

## Project Summary
This is a brief summary of the instructions for the project.  

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:  
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.  
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.  
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.  

## CodeBook.md
Additional information about the variables, data, and transformations are included in the CodeBook.md file.
